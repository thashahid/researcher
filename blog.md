How To Protect Yourself Against Hackers
Are you worried that your tech stuff is
insecure? You know all the ways that a
hacker can spy and steal important and
personal information, but how do you
keep it safe? This chapter goes over how to write stronger passwords, how to guard against sniffers, and ransomware, how to keep safe on public Wi-Fi, and
how to protect your home router.

Passwords
Cracking passwords is the classic
hacker move. They don’t need a lot of
fancy technology or computers to
perform this attack, so just about any
beginner hacker can try and get you this
way. The best way to protect yourself is
to create a really strong password. 

Here are some tips:
Use a combo of symbols, upper
and lowercase, and numbers
Using a mixed password makes it
much harder for a hacker to crack it.
An 8-character password with
symbols, numbers, and
upper/lowercase letters is has 30,000
more combinations than an 8
character password that just uses
lowercase letters. A hacker could
take the time to use software to run
through every combination, but
they’re more likely to skip you and
move onto someone who wasn’t as
smart with their password.

Use a password that doesn’t have
anything to do with your personal
info.

Hackers will look at social media
accounts for information like your
spouse’s name, pets, and so on,
because so many people use pieces
of personal info for their password
It’s way better to write a password
that’s completely random and
unrelated to your life. If your name is
Jimmy and you were born in 1977, a
password like “jimmy1977” will be
very easy for a hacker to guess.

Use a different password for
important accounts
Instead of using one password for
your email, bank, and other important
accounts, create a unique one for
each of them. That way, even if a
hacker gets into one account, they
don’t automatically get into all of them.

Use unique answers for your
security passwords.

If you forget your password, most
websites will have you answer a
security question before sending you
a link to recover it. Make that answer
as unique as a password by adding
numbers or symbols. If the question is
“What was your first pet’s name,”
don’t just have the answer be,
“Muffin.” Make it “MuffiN#5,” or
something else really random that a
hacker wouldn’t be able to figure out
by looking at your social media accounts.

Make sure your password key is
safe.

If you have a bunch of passwords,
you probably have them written down
somewhere, but you will need to hide
that key. Don’t leave physical notes
around your computer, and if you do
have the key on your computer, you
want to hide it in a file that isn’t
obviously important. You can also
use a password manager, though do
your research, because those can be
hacked, too.

Add 2-step verification

This is arguably the best thing you
can do for your personal security. It
requires that you put in your
username, password, and have
access to your phone, so unless the
hacker somehow has all three, they
aren’t able to get into your account.

Brute-force attacks

A common attack against passwords is
brute-force attacks. There are four ways
you can protect yourself:

Keep encrypted data safe.

Once a hacker has actually copied
your data, they can run as many brute-
force attacks as they want. The key
then is to prevent them from getting
the data in the first place. Keep it
encrypted, and keep it hidden. Don’t
have a folder labeled “Important,”
“Private,” or “Passwords” just sitting
out in the open, and definitely don’t
label files so obviously.

Make sure website logins limit.

password attempts
Just about every login site does this,
so it isn’t as big of a deal anymore.
Still, just make sure all the sites you
use have this feature.

Use long, secure passwords.

We discussed this in the section
above, so just know that good
passwords are essential to preventing
brute-force attacks. You want to make
the hacking work as difficult as
possible, so a hacker loses interest
and goes after an easier target.

Use strong encryption algorithms.

Encryption algorithms are utilities
that basically turn your data into a
jumbled code. Without the passcode,
a hacker can’t read the data. The
algorithms have names like Triple
DES, RSA, and Blowfish. AES is
considered one of the best today,
provided that use 256-bit keys, as
opposed to 128-bit. The 128-bit is
easier for hackers to brute-force,
while 256 takes a lot more time and
computing power to crack.

Sniffers

To protect yourself against packet
sniffers, you can install a tool that will
let you know if someone on your
network is using a sniffer. Called
Antisniff, it can detect if someone is
using a sniffer’s promiscuous mode to
capture all your traffic. You can also use
encryption, so even though the sniffer is
getting all the information, it’s
unreadable. If the hacker tries to modify
anything to make it readable, the process
can cause errors and will alert you that
someone is trying to decrypt the data.

Social engineering

The most obvious defense against social
engineering attacks is to use your brain.
Be very skeptical of anything that comes
your way, whether it’s a clickbait-like
article, an IT alert, or “once in a
lifetime” offer. Do a little research on
the source. Try and trace them to see if
they’re legitimate. If your friend posts
something out of character, it’s probably
not them.
To reduce the number of social
engineering attacks, install security
programs that will block malware and
viruses. Be sure the programs are
effective, and don’t get more than you
need. Every software has
vulnerabilities, so even though they are
meant to keep you secure, having too
many programs comes with risks.

Clear out cookies on a regular basis,

which is a little file that gets stored on
your computer when you visit a website,
so the company of the website can track
their consumers. Lock down your
Facebook and other social media
accounts using the privacy settings, so
hackers aren’t able to find info on you
they can use in phishing scams or other
attacks.

Ransomware

The best defense against ransomware is
to keep your data backed up, so if
hackers do get your files, you have other
copies to rely on. Backing up to the
cloud is best, because hackers can get
into your backup systems as well, if they
break into your desktop and then into the
network server. If you do choose to back
up on a storage device that’s not the
cloud, you want it to be offline, and not
connected to a hackable desktop system.
An external hard drive should be
connected to the computer when you’re
putting on the data, and then
disconnected right away.

Don’t open suspicious
emails/links.

One way that hackers install
ransomware is by getting victims to
open a malicious email or link.
Another attack is called
“malvertising,” which is when a
hacker infects an ad email, so you
believe you’re opening an email from
The New York Times, but it’s
ransomware. The easiest way to
avoid the ransomware is to simply
not open suspicious emails or links.
To avoid those malverts, ad blockers
can help. If companies are having
trouble with employees accidentally
installing ransomware, IT training
can make a big difference. One
company that does security
awareness training said 15.9% of
employees used to click on
ransomware, but with training, it
dropped to 1.2%.

Limiting apps and permissions.

Ransomware is a computer
application, so by “whitelisting” only
legitimate apps that you expressly
approve, you can stop ransomware
from getting installed on your
computer. A computer admin can do
this by scanning the computer,
approving the legitimate apps, and
then configuring the computer to stop
all over files from installing.
You can also limit permissions, so
instead of having all the files on one
server, the admin can break the
workplace in smaller groups. That
way, if one server gets attacked and
locked by ransomware, not all the
servers or files are compromised. By
dividing up the files among a lot of
servers, it makes hackers work a lot
harder to get a satisfying number of
files to hold hostage.

Disconnect to prevent spread.

What should you do if someone on
the server does install ransomware?
Disconnect. Disconnect the infected
systems right away from the network
at large, and disable any Bluetooth
and WiFi on all the machines to stop
the spread of the ransomware. It’s
like cutting off a gangrenous limb
before the infection spreads to the
rest of the body. Once the rest of the
system is safe, you can conduct an
“autopsy” on what was infected, and
figure out what to do next.

Keeping safe with public WiFi.

It’s very common to become a victim of
man-in-the-middle attacks when you’re
out in public, like at a coffee shop. Even
if it has a password, that doesn’t mean
it’s safe, because everyone in the coffee
shop is on the same network, and 
often share passwords on review sites
like Yelp. The first thing to do is make
absolutely sure you aren’t connecting to
a fake connection. Ask the coffee shop
what their network is called.
Once you’re on a shared network, make
sure the websites you’re visiting are
encrypted. Getting a browser extension
like HTTPS Everywhere will send you
to the encrypted version of any web
page, if it’s available. With encrypted
sites, a hacker will only be able to see
where you are, but not what you’re
doing, so login credentials are safe.

Another good idea is to pay for a VPN
connection. VPNs, or Virtual Private
Networks, are personal, private
connections used to link to a public
Internet connection. It shields you from
viewers of the public connection. For
the best security, you want a VPN even
when you’re visiting encrypted sites,
because the VPN will hide the your
activity and the names of the sites you’re
visiting. All a hacker will see is that
someone is using a VPN connection.

Protecting your home router
Securing a home router should primarily
be the company’s job, but since they
haven’t been doing it, there are ways you can protect yourself. The first thing to do
is change your router’s administration
password and username. It’s easy for a
hacker to find the default credentials, so
as soon as you get a router, change them.
If a router doesn’t come with a default,
add your own. You should also disable
the remote administration, so a hacker
can’t get control of the router from
another computer.
Once you’ve changed the credentials,
you want to make the network name hard
to guess. The name is called the SSID,
and it will probably be something
simple, like the manufacturer’s name.
You want to change the SSID to
something completely random and
unique, so the hacker can’t guess
anything about the router.
The last two things that keep your router safe are updated firmware and a good encryption. Check the router’s advanced
settings to make sure the firmware is
current. If it isn’t, hackers could exploit
what insecurities they know exist in old
firmware. You should also use WPA2
encryption, which encrypts all the
information the router transmits. Go to
the advanced settings and enable the
WPA2.

What’s next in the hacker world?
We know what hackers are currently up
to, but they’re always pushing the
envelope and transforming their world.
What does the future of hacking hold?
Should we all be scared to death, or
confident that the white hats will work
just as hard as the black hats to keep
everyone safe?
